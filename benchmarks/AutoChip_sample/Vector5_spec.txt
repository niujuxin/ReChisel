I would like you to implement a module named `TopModule` with the following interface. 
All input and output ports are one bit wide unless otherwise specified.

Module Name: `TopModule`
Ports:
  input a,
  input b,
  input c,
  input d,
  input e,
  output [24:0] out

Given five 1-bit signals (a, b, c, d, and e), compute all 25 pairwise one-bit comparisons in the 25-bit output vector. 
The output should be 1 if the two bits being compared are equal.

Hint: 
out[24] = ~a ^ a;   // a == a, so out[24] is always 1.
out[23] = ~a ^ b;
out[22] = ~a ^ c;
